# Multithreading Projects

This repository contains various projects and exercises that demonstrate the use of multithreading in C++ and Win32 API. Multithreading is a technique that allows a program to execute multiple tasks concurrently, which can improve the performance and responsiveness of the application. The projects cover topics such as:

- Creating and managing threads with the Win32 API functions
- Synchronizing threads with mutexes, semaphores, critical sections, and events
- Using thread pools to efficiently manage a large number of threads
- Implementing parallel algorithms
- Developing windows multithreading applications with CMake

The projects are written in C++.The projects are organized into folders according to the topics they cover. Each folder contains a README file that explains the objectives, requirements, and instructions for each project. The projects are suitable for beginners and intermediate learners who want to explore the concepts and techniques of multithreading in C++ and Win32 API.
